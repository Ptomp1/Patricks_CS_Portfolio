    <p>Hello! My name is Patrick and this is going to be my CSC106 Portfolio! It might not look like much of anything right now, but hopefully within a couple months it'll be all filled out and styled! In the meantime, thanks for checking this page out and have a nice day! :) You can navigate back to the home page from here as well as the javascripts page!</p>
